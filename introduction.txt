hi my name is swayam
I am a sophomore studying data science and finance. 
I enjoy playing basketball, badminton, as well as musical instruments.
I like hanging out with friends and going to the gym as well.
I want to a job in tech pretty badly, especially in the usa.
My favourite class in BU was japanese literature, pretty easy.
